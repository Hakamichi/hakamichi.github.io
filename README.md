# Welcome to my landing page!

## I am still working on this page, so apologies if it seems short!

## Who am I?
My name's Henry, full name Henry Hakamichi.

I'm a VTuber, currently inactive, but I have plans on returning back into things soonâ„¢.

I started vtubing at around early 2020 and taking a "small" break. cough cough stupid pandemic cough cough I'm slowing starting coming back to becoming a VTuber once again after not doing anything during that "break".

During my hiatus as a VTuber, I started to dive into other things like Minecraft resource pack development and then into the Technical Minecraft Community, with Ianxofour's server being the first server that I joined. Although I am still learning, I feel like I am vaguely confident on how most things work.

I'm currently a member of a Minecraft server "Nuggtech", joining there at around August of 2022.

What am I going to do now? Well, I'm not exactly sure. But I plan on returning as a VTuber.
